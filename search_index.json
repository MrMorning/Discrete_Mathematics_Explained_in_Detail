Truth Table 真值表\n真值表是研究命题逻辑的重要工具\n在构建真值表时，其实就是在手工模拟计算机枚举的过程\n不难，仅以一题为例\n\nAn island has two kinds of inhabitants, knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie. You go to the island and meet A and B. \nA says “B is a knight.”\nB says “The two of us are of opposite types.”\nWhat are the types of A and B?\n\nLet  p:  \"A is a knight\"\n​       q:  \"B is a knight\" \n\n\n\np\nq\np ↔ q\nq ↔ p ⊕ q\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nT\nF\n\n\nT\nF\nF\nF\n\n\nF\nT\nF\nT\n\n\nF\nF\nT\nT\n\n\n\nSo the answer is that both A and B are knaves.\n1.4.

Contingencies 可能式\nA  contingency is a proposition which is neither a tautology nor a contradiction, such as  p\n2.2. Logical Equivalences 逻辑等价式\nThe compound propositions p and q are called logically equivalent if p ↔ q is a tautology.\n2.2.1. Notation 记号\np ⇔ q or p ≡ q\n\nRemark\nThe symbol ≡ is not a logical connective, and p ≡ q is not a compound proposition but rather is the statement that p ↔ q is a tautology.\n\n2.3.

Predicate 谓词\nA predicate (propositional function 命题函数) is a statement that contains variables. \nOnce the values of the variables are specified, the function has a truth value.\nP(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) n-place (n-ary) predicate n位谓词（n元谓词）\n1.1.2. Quantifiers 量词\nWe need quantifiersto express the meaning of English words including all and some.\nUniversal Quantifier 全称量词\n\"For all\"\n∀\n∀x P(x) is read as \"For all x, P(x)\" or \"For every x, P(x)\"\n\nThe universal quantification of P(x) create a proposition from a propositional function.\n\nExistential Quantifier 存在量词\n\"There exists\"\n∃\n∃x P(x) is read as \"For some x, P(x)\", or as \"There is an xsuch that P(x)\", or \"For at least one x, P(x).\"\nProperties of Quantifiers 量词性质\n\n\n\nStatement\nWhen true?\nWhen false?\n\n\n\n\n\\forall x P(x)\nP(x) is true for every x.\nThere is an x for which P(x) is false.\n\n\n\\exists x P(x)\nThere is an x for which P(x) is true.\nP(x) is false for every x.\n\n\n\nThinking about Quantifiers 深入理解量词\nLoop 循环\nWhen the domain of discourse is finite, we can think of quantification as looping through the elements of the domain.\n\nTo evaluate ∀x P(x) loop through all x in the domain\n\nIf at every step P(x) is true, then ∀x P(x) is true\n\nIf at a step P(x) is false, then ∀x P(x) is false and the loop terminates\n\nTo evaluate ∃x P(x) loop through all xin the domain\n\nIf at some step, P(x) is true, then ∃x P(x) is true and the loop terminates\n\nIf the loop ends without finding an xfor which P(x) is true, then ∃x P(x) is false\n\n\nEven if the domains are infinite, we can still think of the quantifiers this fashion, but the loops will not terminate in some cases.\n\nConjunctions and Disjunctions 合取、析取\nIf the domain is finite, a universally quantified proposition is equivalent to a conjunction of propositions without quantifiers and an existentially quantified proposition is equivalent to a disjunction of propositions without quantifiers.\nIf U consists of the integers 1,2, and 3\n\\forall x P(x)\\equiv P(1)\\wedge P(2)\\wedge P(3)\n\\exists x P(x)\\equiv P(1)\\vee P(2)\\vee P(3)\n\nEven if the domains are infinite, you can still think of the quantifiers in this fashion, but the equivalent expressions without quantifiers will be infinitely long.\n\nOther Quantifiers 其他量词\n Uniqueness quantifier 唯一性量词\n\\exists! or \\exists_1\n∃!x P(x) means that P(x) is true for one and only one x in the universe of discourse.\nPrecedence of Quantifiers 量词优先级\nThe quantifiers ∀and ∃have higher precedence than all the logical operators.\nBinding Variables 量词绑定\nBound Variable 约束的量词\na variable is bound if it is known or quantified.\nFree Variable 自由的量词\na variable neither quantified nor specified with a value\n\nAll the variables that occur in a propositional function must be bound or set equal to a particular value to turn it into a proposition.\nIn the statement ∃x(x + y = 1), the variable x is bound by the existential quantification ∃x, but the variable y is free because it is not bound by a quantifier and no value is assigned to this variable. This illustrates that in the statement ∃x(x + y = 1), x is bound, but y is free.\nHowever, this statement is not a proposition since y is undefined and we can't tell whether it is true or false.\n\n1.2. Logical Equivalences Involving Quantifiers 涉及量词的逻辑等价式\nStatements involving predicates and quantifiers are logically equivalent iff they have the same truth\nx is not occuring in P\n\n量词辖域的扩张\n\n\\forall xP(x)\\vee A\\equiv\\forall x(P(x)\\vee A)\n\\forall xP(x)\\wedge A\\equiv\\forall x(P(x)\\wedge A)\n\\exists xP(x)\\vee A\\equiv\\exists x(P(x)\\vee A)\n\\exists xP(x)\\wedge A\\equiv\\exists x(P(x)\\wedge A)\n\n量词辖域的收缩\n\n\\forall x(A\\to P(x))\\equiv A\\to\\forall xP(x)\n\\exists x(A\\to P(x))\\equiv A\\to\\exists xP(x)\n（下面的两个式子很重要）\n\\forall x(P(x)\\to A)\\equiv\\exists xP(x)\\to A\n\\exists x(P(x)\\to A)\\equiv\\forall xP(x)\\to A\n1.3.

Translating from English into Logical Expressions\nThe very first step is to decide on the domain U.\n\nTranslate the following sentence into predicate logic\n“Every student in this class has taken a course in Java.”\nFirst decide on the domain U.\nSolution 1\nIf U is all students in this class, define a propositional function J(x) denoting “x has taken a course in Java” and translate as ∀x J(x).\nSolution 2\nBut if U is all people, also define a propositional function S(x) denoting “x is a student in this class” and translate as ∀x (S(x)→ J(x)).\n\n1.4.1. A Very Important Notice!!!\n\nEvery student in this class has taken a course in Java\nif U is all people, also define a propositional function S(x) denoting “x is a student in this class”\n\\forall x(S(x)\\wedge J(x)) is not correct!!!\nif there is one x that does not belong to this class, then the whole statement is false!\n\nSome student in this class has taken a course in Java\nif U is all people\n\\exists x(S(x)\\to J(x)) is not correct!!!\nif there is one x that does not brlong to this class, the the whole statement is true!\n\n\n1.5. Premises and Conclusion 前提和结论\nLewis Carroll Example\nAn argument\n\n“All lions are fierce.”\n“Some lions do not drink coffee.”\n“Some fierce creatures do not drink coffee.”\n\nThe first two are called premises（前提） and the third is called the conclusion（结论）.The entire set is called an argument（论证）.\nOne way to translate these statements to predicate logic\nLet p(x), q(x), and r(x) be the propositional functions “xis a lion,” “xis fierce,” and “xdrinks coffee,” respectively. Domain of x: All creatures.\n\n∀x (p(x)→ q(x))\n∃x (p(x) ∧¬r(x))\n∃x (q(x) ∧¬r(x))\n\nLater we will see how to prove that the conclusion follows from the premises.\n2. Nested Quantifiers 嵌套量词\n2.1. Definition 定义\nTwo quantifiers are nested if one is within the scope of the other.\ne.g. \\forall x\\exists yC(x,y)\n2.2. Translating from Nested Quantifiers into English\n\nTranslate the statement \\forall x(C(x)\\wedge \\exists y(C(y)\\wedge F(x,y))) into English, where C(x) is \"x has a computer,\" F(x,y) is \"x and y are friends,\" and the domain for both x and y consists of all students at ZJU. \nSolution\n\nUse variables in the translatint result (Easy and clear)\nFor every student x at ZJU, x has a computer or there is a student y such that y has a computer and x and y are friends.\n\nUnderstand the meaning and report it in English\nEvery student at ZJU has a computer or has a friend who has a computer.\n\n\n\n2.3. Translating English into Logical Expressions Involving Nested Quantifiers\n\nExpress the statement “Everyone has exactly one best friend” as a logical expression with a domain consisting of all people\nSolution\nRewrite the original statement as For every person x , x has exactly one best friend.\nThere is a person y who is the best friend of x, and furthermore, that for every person z, if z is not y, then z is not the best friend of x.\nLet B(x, y) be the statement y is the best friend of x.\n\\forall x\\exists y\\forall z(B(x,y)\\wedge((z≠y)\\to\\neg B(x,z)))\n\n2.4. The Order of Quantifiers 量词顺序\nThe order of nested quantifiers matters if quantifiers are of different types\ne.g.\n\\forall x\\forall yP(x,y)\\equiv\\forall y\\forall xP(x,y)\nHowever\n\\exists x\\forall yP(x,y) is not the same as \\forall y\\exists xP(x,y)\n\nExplanation\nAssume P(x,y) denote \"x loves y\", where the domain for variables x and y consists of all people\n\\exists x\\forall yP(x,y) --> There is someone who loves everyone.\n\\forall y\\exists xP(x,y) --> Everybodyi s loved by somebody.\n\n2.5.

Rules of Inference 推理规则\n\nProofs in mathematics are valid arguments\nAn argument（论证） is a sequence of statements that end with a conclusion\nBy valid（有效性）, we mean the conclusion must follow from the truth of the preceding statements (premises（前提）)\n\n1.1. Valid Arguments in Propositional Logic 命题逻辑的有效论证\nAn argument in propositional logic is a sequence of  propositions. \nAll but the final proposition in the argument are called premises and the final proposition is called the conclusion. \nAn argument is valid if the truth of all its premises implies that the conclusion is true.\nAn argument form（论证形式） in propositional logic is a sequence of compound propositions involving propositional variables.\nAn argument form is valid if no matter which particular propositions are substituted for the propositional variables in its premises, the conclusion is true if the premises are all true. \np_1\\\\p_2\\\\...\\\\p_n\\\\-\\\\\\therefore q\nAn argument in propositional logic is valid when its argument form is valid.\ne.g.\n\n1.2.

Many of these programs make use of a rule of inference known as resolution. This rule of inference is based on the tautology\n\n((p\\vee q)\\wedge (\\neg p\\vee r))\\to(q\\vee r)\nThe final disjunction in the resolution rule, q\\vee r, is called the resolvent（消解式）\n\nResolution is very important in AI!\n\n1.2.2.

Introduction to Proofs 证明导论\n\nThe construction of a valid proof is an art, honed after much practice.\n\n2.1. Some Terminology 一些专业术语\nA proof（证明） is a valid argument that establishes the truth of a mathematical statement\nA theorem（定理） (proposition（命题）/fact（事实）/result（结论）) is a statement that can be shown to be true\nAxioms（公理） (postulates（假设）) are statements we assume to be true\nA lemma（引理） is a less important theorem that is helpful in the proof of other results\nA corollary（推论） is a theorem that can be established directly from a theorem that has been proved\nA conjecture（猜想） is a statement that is being proposed to be a true statement\n\nA conjecture becomes a theorem once it has been proved to be true\n\n2.2.

Informal Proofs 非形式化证明\n\nEach step may involve multiple rules of inference;\n\nSteps may be skipped;\n\nThe axioms being assumed and the rules of inference used are not explicitly stated. \n\n\n2.4. Mistakes in Proofs 证明中的错误\nMany mistakes result from the introduction of steps that do not logically follow from those that precede it.\nMany incorrect arguments are based on a fallacy called begging the question (circular reasoning（循环论证）)\n3. Proof Methods 证明方法\n3.1. Direct Proofs 直接证明\nA direct proof shows that a conditional statement p → q is true by showing that if p is true, then q must also be true\n3.2. Indirect Proofs 间接证明\n3.2.1. Proof by Contraposition 反证法\nP\\to Q\\equiv\\neg Q\\to\\neg P\nVacuous Proof 空证明\nIf we know P is false then  P → Q is vacuously true.\nF → T and F → F are both true.\n\ne.g. If Tom is both handsome and ugly then he feels unhappy.\n\nTrivial Proof 平凡证明\nIf we know Q is true, then P → Q is trivially true\nF → T and T → T are both true.\n\ne.g. If it’s raining today then the empty set is a subset of every set.\n\n3.2.2. Proof by Contradiction 归谬证明法\n\\neg p\\to(q\\wedge\\neg q)\n直接的说，就是先假设p为假，然后推出两个相矛盾的结论\n它与反证法的差别就在于反证法是找到与假设相悖的结论，而归谬证明法是由假设推出两个相悖的结论，即矛盾的产生处不同\n\nExample:\nProve there is no largest prime number.\nProof:\nLet p be the proposition “there is no largest prime number.”\nAssume that ¬p is true, namely, there is a largest prime number, denoted by s.\nHence, the set of all primes lie between 2 and s. \nForm the product of these primes:\n\r\n> r=2×3×5×7×11×…×s\r\n> \nBut r + 1 is a prime or has a prime factor larger than s. \nThis is a contradiction since we have shown that ¬p implies both q and ¬q where q is the statement that s is the largest prime number.\nHence, ¬p is false, so that p, “there is no largest prime number,” is true. \nQ.E.D.\n\nProof  p → q by Contradiction 运用归谬证明法证明蕴含关系\n\nassumes that both p and ¬q are true\n\nshows that (p\\wedge\\neg q)\\to F\n\n\nProofs of Equivalence by Contradiction 运用归谬证明法的等价证明法\np\\leftrightarrow q\\equiv(p\\to q)\\wedge(q\\to p)\n[p_1\\leftrightarrow p_2\\leftrightarrow...p_n]\\equiv[(p_1\\to p_2)\\wedge(p_2\\to p_3)\\wedge...\\wedge(p_n\\to p_1)]\n3.2.3. Counterexamples 反例证明法\nWhen presented with a statement of the form ∀xP(x), which we believe to be false or which has resisted all proof attempts, we look for a counterexample.\n3.3. Proof by Cases 分情形证明法\n就是分类讨论\nNotice:\nYou have to ——\n\nConvince the reader that the cases are inclusive (i.e., they exhaust all possibilities)\nEstablish all implications\n\n\nExample:\nProve that if n is an integer not divisible by 2 or 3, then n2-1 is divisible by 24.\nSolution:\n\nn = 6k+1\n\nn = 6k+5\n\n\n\n3.4. Exhaustive Proof 穷举证明法\nAn exhaustive proof is a special type of proof by cases where each case involves checking a single example\n\nExample:\nShow that there are no solutions in integers x and y of x^2 + 3y^2=8\n\r\n> x = -2,-1,0,1,2\r\n> \n\r\n> y = -1,0,1\r\n> \nBy exhausting every possible situation, we can draw the conclusion that this pair of x and y does not exist.\n\n3.5.

Constructive Existence Proof 构造性证明\n\nEstablish P(c) is true for some c in the domain\nThen ∀xP(x) is true by Existential Generalization (EG)\n\n\nExample:\nShow that there are n consecutive composite positive integers for every positive integer n\nExplanation:\n\\forall n\\exists x((x+i)\\ is\\ composite\\ for\\ i\\ = 1,2,...,n)\nProof:\nLet x = (n + 1)! + 1.\nConsider the integers x + 1, x + 2, … , x + n. \nNote that i + 1 divides x + i = (n + 1)! + (i + 1)\\ for\\ i = 1, 2, … , n​\nHence, n consecutive composite positive integers have been given. \nQ.E.D.\n\n3.5.2. Nonconstructive Existence Proof 非构造性证明\nAssume no c exists which makes P(c) true and derive a contradiction \n\nExample:\nProve that for all integers n, there exists a prime p so that p > n\nProof:\nLet n be an arbitrary integer, and consider n! + 1.  \n\nIf (n! + 1) is prime, we are done since (n! + 1) > n.  \n\nBut what if (n! + 1) is composite?\nIf (n! + 1) is composite then it has a prime factorization:\n\r\n>   p_1×p_2×…×p_k=(n!+1)\r\n>   \nConsider the smallest p_1, it is still larger than n\nLet p = p_1 , then  p > n, and we are done.  \n\n\nQ.E.D.\nNote:\nWE STILL DON’T KNOW WHAT p IS!!!\n\n3.6. Uniqueness Proof 唯一性证明\nThere are two parts of a uniqueness proof:\n\nExistence: We show that an element x with the desired property exists.\nUniqueness : We show that if y¹x, then y does not have the desired property. Equivalently, we can also show that if x and y both have the desired property, then x=y.\n\n\nExample:\nShow that if a and b are real numbers and a ≠ 0, then there is a unique real number r such that ar+b=0\nProof:\n\nExistence:  Note that the real number r = -b/a is a solution of ar + b = 0 because a(-b/a)+b=-b+b=0. Thus, a real number r exists for which ar + b = 0.\n\nUniqueness: suppose that s is a real number such that as + b = 0. Then as + b = ar + b, where r = -b/a. Subtracting b from both sides, we find that as = ar. Dividing both sides of this last equation by a, which is nonzero, we see that s = r. \n\n\nQ.E.D. \n\n4. Proof Strategies 证明策略\n4.1. Forward Reasoning 正向推理\nUsing  premises, together with axioms and known theorems to lead to the conclusion. \n\nExample:\nGiven two distinct positive real numbers x and y, their arithmetic mean is (x+y)/2 and their geometric mean is \\sqrt{xy}, the arithmetic mean is always greater than the geometric mean.\nNote:\nif you start from (x+y)^2≥0, then it's forward reasoning\nif you start from (x+y)/2>\\sqrt{xy}, which is the conclusion, then it's backward reasoning, the strategy which we will talk about right below here.\n\n4.2. Backward Reasoning 反向推理\nTo reason backward to prove a statement q, we find a statement p that we can prove with the property that p → q.\n\nExample:\nSuppose that two people play a game taking turns removing, 1, 2, or 3 stones at a time from a pile that begins with 15 stones. The person who removes the last stone wins the game. Show that the first player can win the game no matter what the second player does.\nProof:\n\nStep n   : Player1 can win if the pile contains 1,2, or 3 stones. \n\nStep n-1: Player2 will have to leave such a pile if the pile that he/she is faced with has 4 stones. \n\nStep n-2: Player1  can leave 4 stones when there are 5,6, or 7 stones left at the beginning of his/her turn. \n\nStep n-3: Player2  must leave  such a pile, if there are  8 stones.\n\nStep n-4: Player1 has to have a pile with 9,10, or 11 stones to ensure that there are 8 left. \n\nStep n-5: Player2  needs to be faced with  12 stones to be forced to leave 9,10, or 11. \n\nStep n-6: Player1  can leave  12 stones by removing 3 stones. \nNow reasoning forward, the first player can ensure a win by removing 3 stones and leaving 12.\n\n\n\n"},"CH02_Basic_Structures/CH02_01_Set.html":{"url":"CH02_Basic_Structures/CH02_01_Set.html","title":"01 Set","keywords":"","body":"1.

Basic 基本属性\n1.1.1. Definition 定义\nA set is an unordered collection of objects. \n集合是对象的一个无序聚集。\n\nNote:\n\nThe Order of elements does not matter {1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1}\nRepetition of elements does not matter {1, 1, 2, 3, 3} = {1, 2, 3} \n\n\nThe objects in a set are called the elements（元素）, or members（成员）, of the set.\nA set is said to contain（包含） its elements.\n\nNote:\n\nUppercase letters are usually used to denote sets, and lowercase letters are usually used to denote elements of sets.\n\na ∈ A:  a is a member (an element) of the set A\na ∉ A:  a is not an element of the set A\n\n\n\n1.1.2. Description 描述方法\nRoster Method 花名册法\nlisting all its members between braces\ne.g. S = {a, b, c, d}\nBrace Notation with Ellipses 省略号记法\nSometimes the roster method is used to describe a set without listing all its members. Some members of the set are listed, and then ellipses (. . .) are used when the general pattern of the elements is obvious.\ne.g. The set S of positive integers less than 100 can be denoted by S = {1, 2, 3, . . . , 99 }\nSet Builder 构造器\nWe characterize all those elements in the set by stating the property or properties they must have to be members.\ne.g.  {x | x is an odd positive integer less than 10}\nTruth Sets 真值集\nGiven a predicate P, and a domain D, we define the truth set of P to be the set of elements x in D for which P(x) is true. \nThe truth set of P(x) is denoted by {x ∈ D | P(x)}.\n1.1.3. Venn Diagrams 文氏图\n\n\nIn Venn diagrams, the universal set U is represented by a rectangle.\nInside this rectangle, circles or other geometrical figures are used to represent sets.\nPoints are used to represent the particular elements of the set.\n\n1.2.

The Size of a Set 集合的大小\nLet S be a set. If there are exactly n distinct elements in S where n is a nonnegative integer, we say that S is a finite（有限的） set and that n is the cardinality（基数） of S.\nNotation: |S| ->  the cardinality of S\ne.g. Let A be the set of odd positive integers less than 10. Then |A| = 5.\n​    |∅| = 0\n\nA set is said to be infinite（无限的） if it is not finite\ne.g. The set of positive integers is infinite\n\n1.2.3. Power Set 幂集\nGiven a set S, the power set of S is the set of all subsets of the set S.\nNotation: P(S) -> the power set of S\n\nNote:\n\n|S|=n implies |P(S)| = 2^n\nS is finite and so is P(S)\nx\\in P(S)\\Rightarrow x\\in S（此处x是一个集合）\\\\x\\in S\\Rightarrow\\{x\\}\\in P(S)（此处x是一个元素）\\\\S\\in P(S)\n\ne.g.\nWhat is the power set of the empty set? What is the power set of the set {∅}?\nThe empty set has exactly one subset, namely, itself. Consequently,\nP(∅) = {∅}.\nThe set {∅} has exactly two subsets, namely, ∅ and the set {∅} itself. Therefore,\nP({∅}) = {∅, {∅}}.\nA good way to check is to make sure |P(S)| = 2^n\n\n1.2.4. Cartesian Products 笛卡尔积\nTuple 元组\nThe ordered n-tuple（有序n元组） (a1, a2, . . . , an) is the ordered collection that has a1 as its first element, a2 as its second element, . . . , and an as its n-th element.\nIn particular, ordered 2-tuples are called ordered pairs（序偶）\n\n(x,y)=(u,v)\\Rightarrow(x=u)\\wedge(y=u)\nIf x\\ne y, then (x,y)\\ne(y,x)\n\nThe Cartesian product of A and B, denoted by A × B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b), where a ∈ A and b ∈ B. \nA\\times B = \\{(a, b) | a\\in A\\wedge b\\in B\\}\nA_1\\times A_2\\times· · ·\\times A_n = \\{(a_1, a_2, . . . , a_n) | a_i\\in A_i\\ for\\ i = 1, 2, . . . , n\\}\n\nNote:\nIf |A|=m, |B|=n, then |A×B|=|B×A|=mn\nA×B≠B×A\nA×∅ = ∅×A = ∅\n\n1.3.

Computability 可计算性\nWe say that a function is computable（可计算的） if there is a computer program in some programming language that finds the values of this function. If a function is not computable we say it is uncomputable （不可计算的）\nTo show that there are uncomputable functions, we need to establish two results. \nFirst, we need to show that the set of all computer programs in any particular programming language is countable. (Proved before)\nNext, we show that there are uncountably many different functions from a particular countably infinite set to itself.\nSo now, there are only a countable number of computer programs. Consequently, there are only a countable number of computable functions. However, there are an uncountable number of functions, so not all functions are computable.\n1.4.2.

We must show that f is not onto.\nLet T=\\{s\\in S|s\\notin f(s)\\}. Although T is in the codomian of f, which is P(S), we will show that T is not in the range of f.\nIf it were, then we would have f(t) = T for some t\\in S\n\nSuppose that t\\in T, then according to the definition of T, t\\notin f(t), thus, t\\notin T, which is a contradiction\nSuppose that t\\notin T, then t\\notin f(t), then t follows the definition of T, so t\\in T, which is again a contradiction\n\nHence, f is not onto. \nIn other words, there does not exist an onto function f from S to P(S)\nStep 2\nThe function sending x to {x} for each x\\in S is a one-to-one function from S to P(S), hence |S|\\leq|P(S)|\nStep 3\nSince there is no onto from S to P(S), then there is no one-to-one correspondence, which implies that |S|\\neq|P(S)|\nAll in All\n|S|\n\n\nHence, by the Cantor’s theorem, |Z^+|, which can be expressed as \\aleph_0\n3. The Hypothesis\nThe famous continuum hypothesis asserts that there is no cardinal number X between \\aleph_0 and c\nIt tells us that the smallest infinite cardinal numbers forms an infinite sequence \\aleph_0,\\aleph_1,\\aleph_2,\\aleph_3,...\nThere are no other cardinal numbers between \\aleph_n and \\aleph_{n+1}, also \\aleph_ {n+1}is the cardinal number of the power set of a set S, whose own cardinal is \\aleph_n\nWhen we talk about \\aleph_0 and \\aleph_1, the continuum hypothesis (CH) asserts that there is no cardinal number （基数） a such that \\aleph_0\nHence, c=2^{\\aleph_0}=\\aleph_1\n"},"CH03_Algorithms/CH03_01_Algorithms.html":{"url":"CH03_Algorithms/CH03_01_Algorithms.html","title":"01 Algorithms","keywords":"","body":"1.

The Validity of Mathematical Induction 数学归纳法的有效性\nThe validity of mathematical induction follows from the well-ordering property（良序性公理） for the set of positive integers.\n1.3. the Well-Ordering Property 良序性公理\nA set S is well ordered  if every nonempty subset of S has a least element.\nFor example, \n\nN is well ordered\n\nZ is not well ordered under the \\leq relation (Z has no smallest element).\n\n(0, 1) is not well ordered since (0,1) does not have a least element. \n\n\nThe well-ordering property : Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a least element. \n1.3.1. Proofs Using the Well-ordering property\ne.g.1\nUse the well-ordering property to prove the division algorithm. The division algorithm states that if a is an integer and d  is a positive integer, then there are unique integers q and r, with 0\\leq r such that a=dq+r.\n\nThe existence part\nLet S be the set of nonnegative integers of the form a-dq, where q is an integer. This set is nonempty.\nBy the well-ordering property, S has a least element r=a-dq0.\nThe integer r is nonnegative. It is also the case that rs=a-d(q_0+1).\nConsequently, there exist integers q and r with 0≤r\n\ne.g.2\nIn a round-robin tournament every player plays every other player exactly once and each match has a winner and loser. We say that the players p_1,p_2,…,p_m form a cycle if p_1 beats p_2, p_2 beats p_3, …, p_{m-1} beats p_m, and p_m beats p_1.\nUsing the well-ordering principle to show that if there is a cycle of length m (m\\geq 3) among the players in a round-robin tournament, there must be a cycle of three of these players\n\nSolution\nWe assume that there is no cycle of three players. Because there is at least one cycle in the round-robin tournament, the set of all positive integers n for which there is a cycle of length n is nonempty. By the well-ordering property, this set of positive integers has a least element k, which by assumption must be greater than three. Consequently, there exists a cycle of players p_1,p_2,…,p_k and no shorter cycle exists.\nBecause there is no cycle of three players, we know that k > 3. Consider the first three elements of this cycle, p_1, p_2, and p_3. There are two possible outcomes of the match between p_1 and p_3. \n\nIf p_3 beats p_1, it follows that p_1, p_2, p_3 is a cycle of length three, contradicting our assumption that there is no cycle of three players. \nIf it is the case that p_1 beats p_3, this means that we can omit p_2 from the cycle p_1, p_2, p_3, . . . , p_k to obtain the cycle p_1,p_3,p_4,...,p_k of length k − 1, contradicting the assumption that the smallest cycle has length k. \n\nWe conclude that there must be a cycle of length three.\n\n\n\n1.4. Why Mathematical Induction is Valid\nProof:\nAssume that there is at least one positive integer for which P(n) is false.\nS: the set of positive integers for which P(n) is false.\nThen S is nonempty.\nBy the well-ordering property, S has a least element, which will be denoted by m.\nThen m\\ne1, m-1 is a positive integer. m-1 is not in S. So P(m -1) is true.\nSince the implication P(m-1)\\to P(m) is also true, P(m) must be true. \nBy contradiction, \\forall nP(n) \n1.5. The Good and Bad of Mathematical Induction\n1.5.1.

Three 5-cent stamps can be replaced by four 4-cent stamps to yield a total of k + 1 cents.\nAssume that P(j) is true for all positive integers j with 12 ≤ j ≤ k, where k ≥ 15. Show that P(k+1) is true under the assumption.Using the inductive hypothesis, P(k-3) holds since k − 3 ≥ 12.  To form postage of  k + 1 cents, add a 4-cent stamp to the postage for k − 3 cents\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe validities of both mathematical induction and strong induction follow from the well-ordering property.\n\nIn fact, mathematical induction, strong induction, and  well-ordering are all equivalent principles.\n\n\n\n4. Connection Between the Three Things 三者关系\nThe Mathematical Induction, the Strong Induction, and the well-ordering property is actually the same thing!\n4.1. 1. From W.P to M.I\nSee the validity of M.I, where the proof from W.P to M.I is given. We will omit the proof here.\n4.2. 2. From W.P to S.I\n\nShow that strong induction is a valid method of proof by showing that it follows from the well-ordering property\n\nAssume that the well-ordering property holds. Suppose that P(1) is true and that the conditional statement [P(1)\\wedge P(2)\\wedge· · ·\\wedge P(n)]\\to P(n+1) is true fore very positive integer n. Let S be the set of positive integers n for which P(n) is false.We will show S = ∅. Assume that S\\neq \\emptyset. Then by the well-ordering property there is a least integer m in S.We know that m cannot be 1 because P(1) is true. Because n = m is the least integer such that P(n) is false, P(1), P(2), . . . , P (m−1) are true, and m−1 ≥ 1. Because [P(1)\\wedge P(2)\\wedge· · ·\\wedge P(m-1)]\\to P(m) is true, it follows that P(m) must also be true, which is a contradiction. Hence, S = ∅.\n4.3. 3. From M.I to W.P\n\n Show that the well-ordering property can be proved when the principle of mathematical induction is taken as an axiom.\n\nSuppose that the well-ordering property were false. Let S be a nonempty set of nonnegative integers that has no least element. Let P(n) be the statement “i\\notin S\\ for\\ i=0,1,...,n” P(0) is true because if 0 ∈ S then S has a least element, namely, 0. Now suppose that P(n) is true. Thus, 0\\notin S,1\\notin S,...,n\\notin S. Clearly, n+1 cannot be in S, for if it were, it would be its least element. Thus P(n+1) is true. So by the principle of mathematical induction, n\\notin S for all nonnegative integers n. Thus, S = ∅, a contradiction.\n"},"CH05_Induction_and_Recursion/CH05_02_Recursive.html":{"url":"CH05_Induction_and_Recursion/CH05_02_Recursive.html","title":"02 Recursive","keywords":"","body":"1.

Show that there exist some consecutive integers such that the sum of these integers is the multiple of n.\n\na_{i}=\\sum_{k=1}^{i} x_{k}(i=1,2, \\ldots, n)\nThen the remainders of a_i divided by n is in the set \\{0,1,…,n-1\\}, and the cardinality of this set is n\n\n\\exists i\\left(n | a_{i}\\right)\nFinished\n\n\\neg\\exists i\\left(n | a_{i}\\right)\n0 will be impossible, so the cardinality of the set is n-1, then we can use the pigeonhole principle\n\n\n\n3.4. e.g.4 Subsequence\nEvery sequence of n^2+1 distinct integers contains a subsequence of length n + 1 that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. \n\nExplanation:\nFor example,   n=2\n4,8,3,6,1\n4->3->1\nLet the sequence be a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n^{2}+1}\nAssociate \\left(x_{k}, y_{k}\\right) to the term a_k, where x_k is the length of the longest increasing subsequence starting at a_k, and y_k is the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting at a_k\nSuppose that there is no increasing or decreasing subsequence of length n+1.Then 1 \\leq x_{k} \\leq n \\quad 1 \\leq y_{k} \\leq n\nHence, there are n \\times n=n^{2} pairs \\left(x_{k}, y_{k}\\right)\nSince there are n^{2}+1 a_{k}, by the pigeonhole principle, it follows that there exist terms a_{i}, a_{j}\\left(1 \\leq i such that \\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)=\\left(x_{j}, j_{j}\\right)\nBut a_i\\neq a_j, so there must be a contradiction\nQ.E.D.\n\n3.5. e.g.5 Ramsey Number\nThe Ramsey number R(m,n), where m and n are positive integers greater than or equal to 2, denotes the minimum number of people at a party so that there are either m mutual friends or n mutual enemies, assuming that every pair of people at the party are friends or enemies.\nAssume that in a group of six people, each pair of individuals consists of two friends or two enemies. Show that there are either three mutual friends or three mutual enemies in the group\n\nLet the six people be a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, a_{5}, a_{6}\nTake a_1 into consideration. Of the five other people in the group, there are either three or more who are friends of a1, or three or more who are enemies of a_1. This follows from the generalized pigeonhole principle. \n\nSuppose that a_i,a_j,a_k are friends of a_1\nthen if any two of them are friends, we have three mutual friends\n\nelse if three of them are all enemies, we have three mutual enemies\n\n\nSuppose that a_i,a_j,a_k are enemies of a_1\nalmost the same as situation 1\n\n\n\nThrough this problem, we see that R(3,3)\\leq 6\nIn addition, we also have that R(3,3)>5 due to a counterexample given below\n\nCounterexample:\nIn this counterexample, there are no mutual friends or enemies\n\n\nSo, we have R(3,3)=6\n3.6.

[特殊题型] 物品数量少于抽屉数量\n\n例如 e.g.2 的拓展 2\n对于此题，我们利用的是“小抽屉”，即自行将24个原抽屉组合为新的一组，将讨论范围缩小至物品数量多于抽屉数量，进而得以运用抽屉原理\n\n"},"CH06_Counting/CH06_04_Algorithms_About_Counting.html":{"url":"CH06_Counting/CH06_04_Algorithms_About_Counting.html","title":"04 Algorithms About Counting","keywords":"","body":"1.

Generating Permutations 生成排列\n\n给定某一个排列，生成按照字典序升序的下一个排列\n\n先从后往前遍历，直到遇到不是降序的第一个数。然后用该数右边大于该数的数中最小的数替换该数，右边剩下的数（含刚刚换下来的数）升序重排即可。\n代码：\nvoid next_permutation(int* a, int n) // 上一个排列为a，a中有n个数，将a转化为下一个排列\n{\n    // STEP 1 找到打破降序的第一个数\n    int i = n - 2;\n    for ( ; i >= 0; i--)\n    {\n        if (a[i]  i; k--)\n    {\n        if (a[k] > a[i])\n            break;\n    }\n    // STEP 3 交换这两个数\n    int temp = a[i];\n    a[i] = a[k];\n    a[k] = temp;\n    // STEP 4 右边余下的数升序重排\n    sort(a + i, a + n);\n}\n\n2. Find the ordinal number for the given permutation 给定排列求序号\n\n基本思想：算出有多少个排列比给定排列小\n\n例如：整数1~k的一个排列a_1,a_2,…,a_k，求其序号\n首先，1到a_1-1放在第一位，会有(a_1-1)\\times((k-1)!)个排列\n其次，1到a_2-1放在第二位，会有(a_2-1)\\times((k-2)!)个排列\n之后，1到a_3-1放在第三位，会有(a_3-1)\\times((k-3)!)个排列\n……\n全部加起来，即得到序号\n代码：\nint index_of_permutation(int* a, int n)\n{\n    // 递推算好1~(n-1)的阶乘，做好准备\n    int factorial[n];\n    factorial[0] = 1;\n    for (int i = 1; i \n3.

Generating Combinations 生成组合\n4.1. 位串表示下的生成组合\n计算机中可以使用位串来表示组合，因此我们只需生成下一个位串即可\n这就等价于二进制下加1\n当然int范围内的我们可以直接加1，但是考虑更加一般化的情景，比如储存在数组或者链表中的位串\n代码如下：\nvoid next_bit_string(int* b, int n)\n{\n    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--)\n    {\n        if (b[i] == 1)\n            b[i] = 0;\n        else\n        {\n            b[i] = 1;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n4.2. 常规数字数组下的生成组合\n如果单纯是用数组存放的组合，也是可以生成排列的，算法如下（规定每个有效的数组中元素都是升序排列的）：\nvoid next_r_combination(int* a, int n, int r)\n{\n    for (int i = r - 1; i > 0; i--)\n    {\n        if (a[i] != n - r + 1 + i)\n        {\n            a[i]++;\n            for (int j = i + 1; i \n"},"CH08_Advanced_Counting_Techniques/CH08_01_Deeper_Discussion_About_Recurrence_Relations.html":{"url":"CH08_Advanced_Counting_Techniques/CH08_01_Deeper_Discussion_About_Recurrence_Relations.html","title":"01 Deeper Discussion About Recurrence Relations","keywords":"","body":"1.
